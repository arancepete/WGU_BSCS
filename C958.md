## My Experiences with Class
For those unfamiliar to Calculus as I was upon starting this course, Calculus can become a huge block in your progress in the degree program. There's a reason colleges use it as a "weeding out" of sorts for the science and engineering degrees. Even worse, this course actually covers both Calculus I and a large portion of Calculus II (Integrals). However, that isn't to say that this class is impossible. In fact, in the last few years, the college has been adding more resources for new students. As of writing this there's actually a daily online tutoring session you can join (the time varies by day).


My suggestion for handling this course is; if you have a good grasp of Calculus already, I would take a second to review Derivatives and Integrals, and then give the Practice Assessment a shot. If you score well on it, you should be fine on the Final Exam. For those new to Calculus, I recommend immediately scheduling time every week with your assigned course mentor as you work through the zybooks. The math team, in my experience as a student, has been fantastic! Plus, having a teacher to simplify things for you is very helpful! Also, when you get to Unit 3, skip to the lesson on the Power Rule and then work through it.


If you think that you're going to never pass this class or that it's too scary, remember, some fool has managed to pass this class before. That means YOU definitely can do it too.

| [Calculus, 3rd Ed by Michael Spivak](https://notendur.hi.is/mbh6/html/_downloads/Calculus%20-%20Michael%20Spivak.pdf) | Textbook | A classic textbook on Calculus. You may not want to use it as a primary source for this course because of the ordering, but it's a great textbook and explains the concepts better than zybooks. | 
| [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) | Tools / Calculators | You may have tried it when you were younger. If you've never heard of it, WolframAlpha is like a search engine for datasets and math solutions. It's a cool tool, but some of the cooler features like step-by-step explanations for math problems are behind a $5-7 a month paywall. | 
| [Derivative Calculator](https://www.derivative-calculator.net/) | Tools / Calculator | The Derivative calculator is another tool similar to WolframAlpha, but uses its own engine called Maxima to compute solutions. It's also free and does give step-by-step solutions. The makers of this also made the Integral Calculator. |
| [Integral Calculator](https://www.integral-calculator.com/) | Tools / Calculator | The Integral Calculator works just like the Derivative Calculator and is also free and offers step-by-step solutions to problems. Both are invaluable for when you need to figure out where you made mistakes on a problem. |
| [Symbolab](https://www.symbolab.com/) | Tools / Calculator | Symbolab is another online math calculator that shows solutions. It also has some extra features, such as practice math problems and a digital notebook, but you have to make an account and the practice problems are limited unless you pay for premium (which appears to only be $2 a month). |

It really is a great calculator, especially once you learn how to use it. Since you're going to need a calculator for this OA, you might as well get one you can use for other courses as well. | 
| [Calculus Using the TI-84 Plus](https://education.ti.com/html/t3_free_courses/calculus84_online/index.html) | Website / Course | So you've bought that swanky TI-84 CE calculator I mentioned above and now you're wondering *"Well yeah, it's a nice calculator, but how am I supposed to do Calculus with this thing?"* Well TI (the company not the rapper) is here to tell you exactly how! This link will take you to an entire course on how to solve Calculus problems on your TI-84. Who would've though! |  
| [GeeksforGeeks' Engineering Mathematics Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics-tutorials/) | Websites | The topics for each section are significantly more condensed than most math courses', but you may find them much more helpful. Definitely check out their Computer Science topic articles as well. |
| [r/learnmath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/) | Websites | The subreddit dedicated to helping you learn math. If none of the resources here seem to help, it's likely you'll find something there or find someone who can answer your questions. |  
| [Mathematics (Stack Exchange)](https://math.stackexchange.com/) | Websites | Another great source to turn to in case any of the above doesn't seem to work. You can sort specific subjects by tag, search existing questions, and ask your own. |
