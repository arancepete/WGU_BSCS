<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Certification Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a certification exam. In order to pass, you must use a voucher generated for you by WGU to sign up for the AXELOS ITIL 4 certification and pass it. After you pass it, you'll need to send WGU your score report in order to receive credit for the course. If you already have the AXELOS ITIL 4 certification, you can transfer it in for credit for this course.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>I took this certification almost directly after C176, the CompTIA Project+ certification course and so I was still used to the business jargon that comes in a standardized exam. After studying the ITIL Cram Card and trying the practice exams for a day, I took the ITIL Exam and passed. It may look like a very scary vocabulary exam, but it's actually far easier than it looks. In fact, if you've gotten past <a href="https://github.com/arancepete/WGU_BSCS/tree/main/C779/C779.md">C779</a> and C176 than you'll likely find this certification to be a far more pleasant experience. Like the exam says, there are no trick questions in the ITIL Exam. Read everything carefully and remember the definitions from the Cram Card and you'll do great. Do not sweat this exam!</p>

I read a few pages into it and it actually seemed far less of a dry read than the UCertify, and all of the Case Studies from the ITIL Foundations app are from this book.</li>
