| Prerequisites: | Required For: | Transfer Information: | Recommended Course Order: |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| No prerequisites are required for this course.<sup>[1]</sup> | No courses require this as a prerequisite.<sup>[1]</sup> | One course, equivalent to 3 units, in physical science (chemistry, geology, physics, or astronomy).<sup>[2]</sup> | Take with [C683 - Natural Science Lab](C683.md) because of content overlap. |

<br />

##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*This course provides students with an overview of the basic principles and unifying ideas of the physical sciences: physics, chemistry, and earth sciences. Course materials focus on scientific reasoning and practical, everyday applications of physical science concepts to help students integrate conceptual knowledge with practical skills.* 

*This course covers the following competencies:**
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.* 
- *The graduate describes the nature and process of science.*
- *The graduate examines applications of physics including fundamental concepts such as forces, motion, energy, and waves.*
- *The graduate examines applications of key chemistry concepts including the structure of matter and the behavior and conservation of matter in chemical reactions.*
- *The graduate describes the underlying organization, interactions, and processes within the Earth system including the Earth's structure and atmosphere, and Earth's interactions within the solar system.*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam called an Objective Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the 70 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- The Nature of Science for 20%
- Physics for 27% 
- Chemistry for 21% 
- Earth Science for 31%

## My Experiences with Class
C165 is WGU's General Education science course. It's meant to give you a survey of the key physical science disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Science. There's also a section on the Scientific Method that you will be expected to know about. Similar to [C182 Introduction to IT](C182.md), the content you're going to be learning in this class is really surface level, the issue a lot of people run into however is how much information you'll be expected to know.


Some of the topics you may want to focus on are those related to Earth Science (which makes up 31% of the exam) such as rock, Earth’s layers and all atmospheric layers, etc. You should try to memorize Newton’s laws of Physics and all of the different types of energy and be able to name them from a description. Parts of an experiment also make up a good portion of the questions, so be sure to know what the different parts of an experiment are (independent variable, dependent variable, etc) and the scientific method’s steps. For Chemistry you’ll want to study bonds and know how to differentiate between all the names of the combinations of elements (compounds, mixtures, etc).


Basically, think of this class as a big vocabulary exam of all of the above topics. You won’t see any extremely technical questions and many of them will seem like common sense to you. So I would stick with the below Quizlet, using the videos created by the course instructors and textbook to fill in anything you don’t know. Consider making a study guide for yourself or create flash cards to help memorize some of the more abstract ideas.


To make things easier, I also recommend trying to take this with [C683 – Natural Science Lab](C683.md) since the two classes have a lot of overlap. C683 requires that you to create a scientific experiment from one of the physical science disciplines and write a paper on it. C165 requires that you pass an exam about the physical sciences and the scientific method. The things you’ll be studying in this class may make choosing a topic, designing an experiment, and talking about the experiment far easier than if you spaced them out. In the same vein, you may find that creating an experiment for some of the topics you struggle with may help you to reinforce them for the exam.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [WGU C165 Integrated Physical Sciences Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/213070013/wgu-c165-integrated-physical-sciences-flash-cards/) | Flash Cards | Like C182, quizzing yourself with the Quizlet on the many vocabulary terms in this course should be about enough to pass. | 
| [Integrated Physical Science Textbook](https://wgu-nx.acrobatiq.com) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. It's not a long read and covers everything you'll need to know for this exam. Between this and the Quizlet, you'll be fine. |  
| [101science.com](http://101science.com/) | Website | Probably the greatest website on the internet for learning about science. If there's a concept you're struggling with this site will likely either have a page on it, a link to something better, or a book that can help you. |
