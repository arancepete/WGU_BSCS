<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>C191 Textbook - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the interactive textbook for the class. Personally I've never seen it so I don't know whether it's zybooks or UCertify.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.os-book.com/OS9/">Operating System Concepts 9th Edition by Avi Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne</a> - The textbook that I believe this course is actually based on. It's definitely the most recommended Operating Systems book I know. Be sure to check out the exercises included on the website.</li>
