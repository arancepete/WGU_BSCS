# C173 – Scripting and Programming – Foundations – 3cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None, although having some experience programming beforehand will make this class a cakewalk.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C867.md">C867 - Scripting and Programming - Applications</a></li>
  <li>Potentially <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C949.md">C949 – Data Structures and Algorithms I</a></li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 70 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Introduction to Computer Programming</b> for 20%, <b>Basic Constructs of Programming</b> for 20%, <b>Algorithms</b> for 14%, <b>The Design Process</b> for 26%, and <b>Programming Languages</b> for 20% of the assessment.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>In the same vein as <a href="">C182 Introduction to IT</a>, C173 is a survey of programming and software engineering concepts at a very shallow level. If you've ever programmed anything in your life before this course, you'll probably be able to knock it out within a week like I did. Between the fantastic Lynda.com course by Simon Allardice, Quizlet, and the Zybooks, this ia very easy course. Although, even if you have programmed before, it's possible you will learn a new thing or two.</p>
<p>The only thing that may trip you up about C173 is UML, the Universal Modeling Language. While reading the Zybooks, pay special attention to the finer details about what exactly it is and how it works because you will be tested on it and if you're already struggling with the breadth of topics surveyed in this course, you could potentially fail. More importantly, the Software Design Process and UML chapters in this course are very important topics to understand for later courses.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals/welcome?u=2045532">Programming Foundations: Fundamentals (2011) by Simon Allardice</a> - This video course by Simon Allardice will cover everything you're going to need to know for this exam. Not only is Simon a fantastic teacher, this course covers a lot of ground without being confusing. Unfortunately since Simon now works with Plurasight, Linkedin Learning has retired all of his Programming Foundations courses and replaced them with new ones (some of which, like the new Programming Foundations: Fundamentals, don't cover little material and do so very shallowly). It's possible that backups of Simon's courses exist somewhere else on the Internet...oh...I don't know...maybe you should try googling them.</li>
