<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>

  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2015/welcome?u=2045532 ">Programming Foundations: Databases (2015) by Simon Allardice </a> - If you're new to Databases, be sure to watch Simon Allardice's video course on them. It's been retired from Linkedin Learning but is still watchable for now. Likely this won't be for long, so you may have to find a backup of it in the future.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> - Since this is the first in a series of four courses that require you to understand and use SQL, it might be a good idea to download and start playing around with it. I've included a video course below for just that.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqIk2PwP0To">SQL Tutorial 2020 by Derek Banas</a> - This is a several hour long video course that will walk you through the fundamentals of using SQL. I recommend coding along with it to get yourself used to using it for the following courses.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">W3Schools' SQL Tutorial</a> - If you prefer working along with a self-paced tutorial instead, W3Schools is a good resource as well.</li>
