## My Experiences with Class
This course used to be very late in the program behind even the [Discrete](C959.md) [Math](C960.md) classes and right before its partner class, C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms II, but now it's common to take it as soon as after [C173 - Scripting and Programming - Foundations](C173.md). However, this course, when partnered with C959 - Discrete Mathematics I, is the best introduction to serious computer science concepts that you will get. Although I've seen it suggested that this course should be taken before C959, I think taking it with C959 is the better option. Think of it like how brick-and-mortar universities often require you to take both Calculus I and Physics I together. Calculus I provides the theory for the formulas that you will apply in Physics I. In the same vein, Discrete Mathematics I provides the logical reasoning for why the data structures and algorithms you learn in Data Structures and Algorithms I work in code.


That said, this course is by no means difficult. It's not the deep dive into data structures and algorithms that you may expect, but an overview of what data structures are, what types exists, how they work, and how they're implemented. You will learn about algorithms in this course, but it's more akin to what *are* algorithms, what *are* the different types, and what they do when used. You'll be focusing on Searching and Sorting Algorithms in particular and they WILL make up a large portion of the Objective Assessment.


You'll also learn about Big-O, which is how algorithm efficiency is measured. You won't need to memorize the Big-O notation of every algorithm that exists, but you will need to understand how to recognize the notation from a given sample of code. Aside from Big-O and Searching and Sorting Algorithms, you should make sure to pay extra attention to Trees Traversals, and the properties of every data structure (what it is, how it works, and what it can/can't do).


Although the Zybooks is taught in Python, the exam itself is language agnostic, so you will need to be able to follow code samples more than understand the actual syntax of Python. At first glance it may look overwhelming, but with the Zybook and a few of the other resources below, you'll find this course is actually pretty easy. And, if you studied hard, the topics covered in this class will be one of the first big steps you take from being a *programmer* to *computer scientist*.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Eric Christiansen's C949 Supplemental Support Page](https://sites.google.com/wgu.edu/eric-christiansen/home/C949?authuser=0) | Professor's Website | You're going to see me reference this website a lot for the upper degree courses because it's a treasure trove of resources. Definitely bookmark it. | 
| [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) | Interactive Course | While you won't actually be required to implement anything for the Objective Assessment or even program in Python, but eventually you will have to. C949 was originally meant to be the course you learned Python for to use in C950, so I recommend at least practicing it. Freecodecamp has a course on Python and also one using Data Structures and Algorithms, but in JavaScript. | 
| [W3Schools' Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) | Interactive Courses | W3 School's HTML and CSS tutorials were integral to my learning to code as a child, it turns out they also have a Python one to get you up to speed on the Python language. | 
| [Coursera's Algorithms, Part 1 with Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | Interactive Course | Authors of one of the three big Algorithm textbooks, also named Algorithms, Part 1, this Coursera course covers Algorithms in the Java programming language, but the concepts transcend language. Also make sure to check out their Algorithms, Part 2 (also the name of another textbook). | 
| [Tutorialpoint's Python Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) | Interactive Course | Suggested by one of the course's professors, TutorialPoint has a lot of free Computer Science tutorial courses. | 
| [MIT'S 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011 Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) | Videos / Video Course | The video lectures from MIT's Introduction to Algorithms course, like Algorithms, Part 1, is based on one of the most popular books on algorithms. This time it's based on Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Ed. If you'd like to follow along, be sure to check out the [OpenCourseWare's lecture notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-notes/). |
| [Michael Sambol’s Big-O Notation and Algorithm Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelSambol/videos) | Video | Before I took the exam, I went through Sambol’s videos on Big-O. They’re short and sweet and provide clear explanations. If you’re struggling with this topic, I suggest giving them a watch. |
| [Colt Steele’s Complete Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS_gr2_-ws8) | Video | You may know Colt Steele from his Udemy courses, but his Big-O Notation video is also really great for this course. |
| [C949: Data Structures & Algorithms I Zybook](https://learn.zybooks.com) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. It's a really fantastic textbook, I highly recommend reading it. Between it and A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures, I was able to easily pass the exam. | 
| [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python by Brad Miller and David Ranum](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) | Interactive Textbook | Another interactive textbook on Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. The difference between this one, however, is that less time is devoted to explaining basic programming fundamentals with Python, instead you'll get longer explanations for Data types and Algorithms. | 
| [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/a-common-sense-guide/9781680502794/) | Textbook | This "plain English" book will teach you everything you're going to need about Searching and Sorting algorithms to meet the Algorithms portion of the exam. It's also a short read. | 
| [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) | Textbook | Although having a complete understanding of Python and its syntax isn't required for passing the Objective Assessment, I recommend taking the time to learn it since you WILL need to for C950 (which this class used to be the preparation for). | 
| [Think Python, 2nd Ed by Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) | Textbook | One of Allen B. Downey's free programming textbooks. He kindly provides both it and the supporting code for it for free! (Be sure to get the supporting code from the GitHub repo). |
| [Python® Notes for Professionals book by GoalKicker.com](https://goalkicker.com/PythonBook/) | Notes | A free 800+ page book of compiled documentation on the Python programming language. Download it, it's completely worth it. | 
| [Algorithms Notes for Professionals book by GoalKicker.com](https://goalkicker.com/AlgorithmsBook/) | Notes | Another free book from the above source. This time it's only around 300 pages and is filled with clear explanations of Algorithms in code and diagrams. If you really want to see what the other books are talking about, download this! | 
| [Data Structures and Algorithms for Beginners by Adrian Mejia](https://adrianmejia.com/categories/coding/data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa/) | Website | A set of tutorials on Data Structures and Algorithms written for beginners. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Python Programming Language Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) | Website | GfG's tutorial on the Python programming language. It goes far beyond the basics and into concepts like Machine Learning with Python, which you may want to bookmark for using during [C964](C964.md). | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Data Structures Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) | Website | GfG's Data Structures tutorials, which cover far beyond what is actually required for the class (some of which you will likely see in [C959](C959.md). The lessons are language-agnostic, focusing more on diagrams and psuedocode, but do contain actual code samples for a variety of languages, including C++, Python, and Java.| 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Algorithms Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) | Website | Similar to the above GfG set of tutorials for Data Structures, Algorithms is also language-agnostic, but offers code samples when needed. If you're struggling with Big-O, you may find the first section useful. And, just like the above, the tutorials go far beyond what you will be required to know for this exam. | 
| [Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) | Website | While you learn about Big-O Notation from the below books, make sure to bookmark this for reference for both this class and C950. |
