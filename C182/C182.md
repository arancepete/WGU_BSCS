<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>When you start this degree program, this course is guaranteed to be in your first term if you haven't managed to transfer something in for it. It is a very simple course that gives you a overview of the topics that you'll learn for the remainder of the program, on a surface level. Some people may find this class to be a bit tricky as they get used to both the testing environment at WGU and because of the large range of topics covered.</p>
<p>If you use the Quizlets brought up in the Reddit write-ups as well as the one below, you should be able to finish this course within a day if not a few. I was able to finish this course in my first week just quizzing myself. If you're able to get access to the course textbook and the quizlet before the program starts, it's absolutely possible to knock this course out on your first day. Don't sweat it.</p>
