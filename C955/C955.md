##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Applied Probability and Statistics helps candidates develop competence in the fundamental concepts of basic statistics including introductory algebra and graphing; descriptive statistics; regression and correlation; and probability. Statistical data and probability are used in everyday life, science, business, information technology, and educational settings to make informed decisions about the validity of studies and the effect of data on decisions. This course discusses what constitutes sound research design and how to appropriately model phenomena using statistical data. Additionally, the content covers simple probability calculations based on events that occur in the business and IT industries. No prerequisites are required for this course.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.* 
- *The graduate applies the operations, processes, and procedures of fractions, decimals, and percentages to evaluate quantitative expressions.*
- *The graduate applies the operations, processes, and procedures of basic algebra to evaluate quantitative expressions, and to solve equations and inequalities.*
- *The graduate evaluates categorical and quantitative data pertaining to a single variable using appropriate graphical displays and numerical measures.*
- *The graduate evaluates the relationship between two variables through interpretation of visual displays and numerical measures.*
- *The graduate evaluates the relationship between two quantitative variables through correlation and regression.*
- *The graduate applies principles and methods of probability-based mathematics to explain and solve problems.*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam called an Objective Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the 68 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages for 4% 
- Basic Algebra for 10% 
- Descriptive Statistics for a Single Variable for 19%
- Descriptive Statistics for Two Variables for 19% 
- Correlation and Regression for 22%
- Probability</b> for 25%

## My Experiences with Class
This course is a very easy, math general education course. If you've enrolled in the degree program recently, you'll likely have this course in your first term. When I started, this course was far in the back of the degree program along with [C949 - Data Structures and Algorithms I](../C949/C949.md) and [C836 - Fundamentals of Information Security](../C836/C836.md), all three of which are actually far better introductory courses than [C958](../C958/C958.md), [C867](../C867/C867.md), and [C172](../C172/C172.md). It's almost a joke that Calculus I was before this class because knowing Basic Algebra is important to understanding Calculus! 


Enough about that however, if you have any previous experience with the topics; algebra, statistics, and probability, you'll likely be able to jump straight to the Objective Assessment and pass. If not, the textbook for this course actually isn't too bad and there's a lot of very helpful learning resources below. 


Don't stress out about this course! And make sure you're comfortable with fractions and graphs for the Objective Assessment. Remember, while this is a math course and you can use a calculator, it won't do much to help if you don't understand *how* to do the problems.

### Learning Resources

Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Khan Academy' Algebra I Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra) | Interactive Online Course | If you need a refresher, Khan Academy is a great place to practice. You likely won't need to go through the entire thing however, since most of the test will be on Statistics and Probability. | 
| [Khan Academy's Statistics and Probability Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) | Interactive Online Course | For those who haven't really been acquainted with Statistics and Probability before, this course provides a good introduction and practice for what you'll need to understand for the exam. It's also not very long. | 
| [Udacity Course: Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101) | Interactive Online Course | In case you prefer a structured course, Udacity offers a free one, Intro to Statistics. | 
| [Udacity Course: Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) | Interactive Online Course | This may be overkill for the OA, but knowing it will help with future courses. Namely those involving Machine Learning. |
| [Udacity Course: Intro to Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201) | Interactive Online Course | This may be overkill for the OA, but knowing it will help with future courses. Namely those involving Machine Learning. |
| [Applied Probability and Statistics Textbook](https://wgu.mindedgeonline.com) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. I never used it personally, but it is there. | 
| [Introductory Statistics by OpenStax](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics) | Textbook | In case you learn better through regular textbooks, OpenStax's free Introductory Statistics textbook also covers everything you'll need for the bulk of the exam. | 
| [Professor Leonard's Statistics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FtHB7V14Fo&list=PL5102DFDC6790F3D0) | Videos / Video Course | If you prefer to learn through videos, I suggest you check out Professor Leonard's course on Statistics. He records his lectures in their entirety so you'll feel just like another student in his class! | 
| [The Organic Chemistry Tutor's Statistics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BVsziIRdfv4Hl4UIqDZhXWV) | Videos / Video Course | Another solid choice for math channels, The Organic Chemistry Tutor. His videos have a lot of great examples and he typically gets to the *point* of the video very quickly. | 
| [CliffNotes' Statistics Study Guide](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/statistics) | Websites / Notes | If you're finding some of the other resources difficult to understand, CliffNotes has a very beginner-friendly explanation for each concept in their Study Guide. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Engineering Mathematics Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics-tutorials/) | Websites | The topics for each section are significantly more condensed than most math courses', but you may them much more helpful. Definitely check out their Computer Science topic articles as well. |
| [r/learnmath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/) | Websites | The subreddit dedicated to helping you learn math. If none of the resources here seem to help, it's likely you'll find something there or find someone who can answer your questions. |  
| [Mathematics (Stack Exchange)](https://math.stackexchange.com/) | Websites | Another great source to turn to in case any of the above doesn't seem to work. You can sort specific subjects by tag, search existing questions, and ask your own. |
