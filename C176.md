# C176 – Business of IT – Project Management – 4cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None, but taking <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C846.md">C846 – Business of IT – Applications</a> after is recommended.</li>
 <li>I recommend taking <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C188.md">C188 - Software Engineering</a> as close to it as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Certification Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a certification exam. In order to pass, you must use a voucher generated for you by WGU to sign up for the CompTIA’s Project+ certification and pass it. After you pass it, you'll need to send WGU your score report in order to receive credit for the course. If you already have the CompTIA Project+ certification, you can transfer it in for credit for this course.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>When I started on the degree program, this was a "second term" course. I've heard it's been relegated to later in the degree program, but that isn't to say this is challenging by any means. Just like <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C779.md">C779 - Web Development - Foundations</a> and C846 - Business of IT - Applications, passing this course requires that you learn the exam just as much as you learn the topics. Project Management as a topic isn't too complicated. In fact, it's probably going to be the most useful certification of the trio that you receive and project management as a subject is useful to know when it comes to planning and executing software projects as well. This is part of the reason why I suggest taking this directly before C188 - Software Engineering as well. </p>
<p>There are a few methods I've seen suggested to prepare for Project+. A lot of people recommend going through the Plurasight videos I have linked below. However, instead of watching them I took a different approach. Recently I'd had to take another standardized exam for work and used an app from a company called PocketPrep. I enjoyed it so much that I found their Project+ app and decided to use it as well. Combined with the trying some of the Project+ official Practice Test questions and filling in any holes I had with an unofficial Project+ book and Fearless Formulas PDF that I have below, I was able to easily pass.</p>
<p>In the WGU crowds I don't see a lot of people mention the PocketPrep apps, but for those who frequently take standardized tests like CompTIA exams, PocketPrep is actually brought up pretty often. It's a great tool and a few things I really liked about them are that a) the questions in the apps are either taken directly from the practice tests or are very similarly worded. It also gives you direct explanations for why you were correct/wrong for every question. b) their $25 premium versions<sup>[1]</sup> (which is the only time I'd co-sign paying for study materials at WGU), give you hundreds of practice questions and a full money back guarantee if you try every question once and still fail the exam. And I did try every Project+ question on the app, just like the other exam I used the company for, and passed both. c) the app uses the same kind of spaced repetition that you might be familiar with if you've ever used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo">Anki</a><sup>[2]</sup>. You can set up reminders in the app to take a practice test, or, if there's a specific competency that you feel you need to practice, you can custom tailor your practice tests to have more of those questions, or even ENTIRELY those questions.</p>

You can reach it through the Plurasight link above in case this link doesn't work (it's on the right, look under "Practice Exams"). The practice exams are free for Plurasight/WGU students as well and I've heard they're good, but I preferred using PocketPrep.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.pocketprep.com/exams/comptia-project/ ">PocketPrep CompTIA Project+ app</a> - This is the practice exam app I used for both Project+ and an exam for work. You can download if for both Android and Apple and the premium version is $25 if I remember correctly. It may seem like a lot, but it comes with a money-back guarantee in case you fail your exam after having tried every question once. I've done exactly that for two exams and have not failed, so I definitely trust them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vAdAam99Yc5fEwJRekJB7mA22XSWrjcy/view">Fearless Formulas</a> - This is something I've also seen a lot. Yes, you will see the formulas on the exam. I don't remember any questions in PocketPrep for them, so I gave this a read and memorized the EVM formulas (last page).</li>
