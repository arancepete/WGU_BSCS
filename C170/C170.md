##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*This course covers conceptual data modeling and provides an introduction to MySQL. Students will learn how to create simple to complex SELECT queries including subqueries and joins, and students will also learn how to use SQL to update and delete data. Topics covered in this course include exposure to MySQL; developing physical schemas; creating and modifying databases, tables, views, foreign keys/primary keys (FKs/PKs), and indexes; populating tables; and developing simple Select-From-Where (SFW) queries to complex 3+ table join queries.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.*
- *The graduate creates conceptual data models and translates them into physical schemas.*
- *The graduate creates databases utilizing SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.*
- *The graduate writes code to create and modify tables and views employing SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.*
- *The graduate writes code to create and modify Primary Keys (PKs) and Foreign Keys (FKs) and Indexes with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.*
- *The graduate populates tables with insert, update, and delete using DML in MySQL environment.*
- *The graduate creates simple Select-From-Where (SFW) and complex 3+ table join queries with Data Manipulation Language (DML) in MySQL environment.*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exams
This course uses an exam called an Objective Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass two Assessments.
- Previously (before Sept. 13th 2021) two Objective Assessments, one 11 question live coding exam and another regular 63 question exam.
- Now, you need to pass a Objective Assessment and a Performance Assessment.

To prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- Conceptual Models to Physical Schemas for 21% 
- Create Databases for 14% 
- Create/Modify Tables and Views for 19% 
- Create Primary Keys/Foreign Keys and Indexes for 17% 
- Populate Tables for 9% 
- Create Simple & Complex Queries for 21%

## My Experiences with Class
After taking [C175 - Data Management Foundations](../C175/C175.md), I found this course to be pretty straight forward. Your focus will shift towards modeling and normalizing database tables and writing SQL code. I am a somewhat seasoned developer, and even I was unsure of the normalization part of the PA. As for the SQL, practice, practice, practice...and know how to describe in great detail the normalization phases. If you’re looking for more information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [C170 - Data Management - Applications Textbook](https://my.wgu.edu/) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. | 
| [C170 - Data Management - Applications Syllabus](https://partners.wgu.edu/Course%20Descriptions%20%20Courses%20of%20Study/C170%20-%20Course%20of%20Study%20-%20Data%20Management%20-%20Applications%20-%204%20CUs.pdf) | Syllabus | The course syllabus, although I think it may be a bit outdated because it doesn't mention the second Objective Assessment. It may give you a better idea of what to look forward to however. | 
| [Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management, 12th Ed by Carlos Coronel and Steven Morris](https://www.cengage.com/c/database-systems-design-implementation-management-12e-coronel/9781305627482/) | Textbook | The textbook suggested in the above syllabus in case you'd like some extra reading material. | 
| [SQL Notes for Professionals book by GoalKicker.com](https://goalkicker.com/SQLBook/) | Textbook | A free and fantastic reference for everything related to SQL. Even if you don't intend to read the entire thing, it's worth having as a reference. | 
| [MySQL® Notes for Professionals book by GoalKicker.com](https://goalkicker.com/MySQLBook/) | Textbook | Since you'll be working with the MySQL, having this on hand with the above book will come in handy. | 
| [W3Schools' SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) | Interactive Online Course | In case you don't find the course textbook helpful, W3Schools offers their own SQL tutorial. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' SQL Tutorial ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/) | Website | GeeksforGeeks also offers their own SQL tutorial in the middle of a larger section on Database Management Systems. It may cover more than this course requires, but it's definitely worth bookmarking for later. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Database Management System Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/) | Website | The larger section on Database Management Systems from GeeksforGeeks that the above comes from. Beyond SQL, understanding how databases work themselves is an important concept to learn. | 
| [Udacity Courses: Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) | Interactive Online Course | Udacity offers a course on relational databases. It does require some knowledge of Python which [you may or may not have learned from this course](C949.md). | 
| [Programming Foundations: Databases (2015) by Simon Allardice](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2015/welcome?u=2045532) | Video Course | If you're new to Databases, be sure to watch Simon Allardice's video course on them. It's been retired from Linkedin Learning but is still watchable for now. Likely this won't be the case for long, so you may have to find a backup of it in the future. | 
| [SQL Tutorial 2020 by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqIk2PwP0To) | Video Course | This is a several hour long video course that will walk you through the fundamentals of using SQL. If you haven't watched it by now, I recommend it. | 
| [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) | Website | Aside from the labs, working with SQL in the MySQL Workbench will likely be helpful for the Coding Objective Assessment. |
