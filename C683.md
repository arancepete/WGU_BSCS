## My Experiences with Class
Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I haven’t enrolled in it yet. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Natural Science Lab Textbook](https://my.wgu.edu/home) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. | 
| [Purdue's APA Formatting and Style Guide, 7th Ed](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html) | Website / Guide | If you're new to writing papers in APA Style, you may want to read this guide on the format from Purdue since your paper must be in APA Style. | 
| [Writing a Hypothesis](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-fair/writing-a-hypothesis) | Website / Article | If you need help creating a testable hypothesis for your experiment, this article should give you some advice. | 
| [How to Write a Testable Question](https://www.monroecti.org/cms/lib07/PA03000492/Centricity/Domain/37/how_to_write_a_testable_question_ppt.pdf) | Website / Guide | This should get you up to speed on everything you'll need to know to create your hypothesis, define your variables, and put on an experiment you can use. | 
| [200 Science Fair Projects that Will Wow Judges](https://www.winter.k12.wi.us/community/sciencefair/sciencefairideas.pdf) | Website / Article | If you're struggling with an idea for an experiment, hopefully some of the ideas in this article will help you come up with something. Remember the restrictions however; this has to be something you can test, it can't involve computer science, psychology, sociology, computer simulations, brand comparisons, or vertibrate animals.  | 
| [101science.com](http://101science.com/) | Website | Probably the greatest website on the internet for learning about science, they have an entire section on experiments and if you need to read up on a specific discipline for your experiment, this is the site to look. | 
| [ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/search) | Website | For your paper you will have to do a literature review with two sources. To do that you will actually need some sources to review! So here's a search engine for scientific articles. Try using some of the terms related to your experiment. |
