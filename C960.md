##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Discrete Mathematics II addresses abstract, discrete, computational methods used in computer science. In particular, this class introduces searching and sorting algorithms; big-O estimates; number theory and cryptography; recursion and induction; counting and advanced counting techniques; discrete probability; and modeling computation. This course emphasizes applications in computer science. Discrete Mathematics I is a prerequisite for this course.* 

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.* 
- *The graduate analyzes linear algorithms and associated big-O estimates.* 
- *The graduate analyzes the use of number theory in cryptography.* 
- *The graduate analyzes recursive elements of algorithms, using applicable induction principles.* 
- *The graduate solves problems using counting principles.* 
- *The graduate analyzes mathematical problems using discrete probability or Bayesian methods.* 
- *The graduate determines computational models using deterministic and nondeterministic finite-state machines*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam called an Objective Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the 72 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:

| [Kimberly Brehm's Discrete Math Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/KimberlyBrehm/playlists) | Videos / Video Courses | Back for round three, we have more Discrete Math videos by Kimberly Brehm. Unfortunately, the ones we'll be needing for this course aren't in one large playlist like the DM 1 videos, but organized by units. | 
| [TI-84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plus-ce) | Tool / Calculator | Every math course needs a good calculator, and the TI-84 is probably the most recommended calculator of the bunch in the subreddit. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Engineering Mathematics Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics-tutorials/) | Websites | The topics for each section are significantly more condensed than most math courses', but you may find them much more helpful. Definitely check out their Computer Science topic articles as well. |
| [GeeksforGeeks' Theory Of Computation and Automata Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/theory-of-computation-automata-tutorials/) | Websites | GfG's tutorials cover Finite-State machines, although it's probably more than you need for this course. Their explanations may be more helpful however. |
| [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) | Websites | Psst, hey, wanna know a secret? Now that you know all this Discrete Math stuff you should try solving some of those "Programming problems" since they'll help you practice your new skills. |
| [r/learnmath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/) | Websites | The subreddit dedicated to helping you learn math. If none of the resources here seem to help, it's likely you'll find something there or find someone who can answer your questions. |  
| [Mathematics (Stack Exchange)](https://math.stackexchange.com/) | Websites | Another great source to turn to in case any of the above doesn't seem to work. You can sort specific subjects by tag, search existing questions, and ask your own. |
