# C836 – Fundamentals of Information Security – 3cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C172.md">C172 - Network and Security - Foundations</a> although I recommend you take this one first or concurrently.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 78 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Fundamental Principles and Concepts</b> for 25%, <b>Impact of Policies and Procedures</b> for 14%, <b>Violations</b> for 10%, <b>Protecting Organizational Assets</b> for 15%, <b>The CIA Triad</b> for 25%, and <b>Security Guidelines</b> for 10% of the assessment.</p> 

<br />

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>I took this course directly after passing C172 - Network and Security - Foundations and concurrently with <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C961.md">C961 – Ethics in Technology</a>. Personally, I think the three courses should be taken either one after another or closely together because there's so much overlap between them (although C961 isn't AS much as C172 and C836). When I started in the program C172 was a first-term course and C836 was near the end of the program. I was lucky that not only could courses be activated before enrolling (thus I was able to read the C836 textbook before I had access to the course), but my Program Mentor allowed me to pull it and C961 forward to the term preceding C172.</p>
<p>If you've taken C172, this should be a very easy pass. Just read the UCertify and brush up on the CIA Triad (which gets a few more letters in this course...) and study your security policies carefully. This should be a very easy win for you. If not, I have some suggested video courses below that will definitely get you across that finish line.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/professormesser/videos">Professor Messer's CompTIA Security Videos</a> - If you've read my write-up on C172, you'll know by now how important Professor Messer's videos were for helping me pass that course. His Security+ videos also happen to be the perfect supplement for this course.</li>  
  <li><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/network-security-fundamentals/table-of-contents">Plurasight's Network Security Basics by Ross Bagurdes</a> - Ross Bagurdes' Security+ course is a fantastic watch, similar to the above. Personally, I think it's one of the most beginner-friendly courses on the subject. Even better, you can watch it and still understand it at 2X speed.</li>  
  <li><a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-is-the-cia-triad">F5's What Is the CIA Triad? by Debbie Walkowski</a> - The CIA Triad was important for C172, but it's even more important in C836. Make sure that you truly understand what each part means and how they relate to Security threats.</li>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>

  <li><a href="https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/114581836">Fundamentals of Information Security UCertify</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the UCertify for the class. This UCertify is absolutely fantastic, probably the best UCertify that you'll get from the program. It also happens to be the best resource for understanding Security for this degree program. It does a far better job than C172's Security section and goes into far better detail on the CIA Triad, which you MUST understand to pass both courses.</li>
