<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> This course has since been updated from a CIW Site Development Associate certification course to an in-house Objective Assessment. I haven't found a competentcy break-down for the new course just yet, but from some of the write-ups and comments, it appears that this course was designed to put more emphasis on syntax and coding. If that is the case, I recommend using a few of the links below to practice HTML and CSS in an online editor to help reinforce your learning. There's also a Quizlet that was created by a Web Dev course mentor that covers syntax that should help. As I learn more about the changes I will be sure to update this page.</p>

<p><b>REFLECTS CERTIFICATION VERSION:</b> This will likely be another course that winds up in your first term at WGU. From the outside you would expect it to be a fun web development course, but in reality, the certification you're going to be taking for C779 will require you to know more about HTML5 standards and business practices than actual HTML or CSS code. That isn't to say you should refrain from learning anything about HTML or CSS, you will see some questions that require you to accurately fix or explain what a piece of code does. But learning the Business side of Web Dev is a far bigger chunk of this exam than you'll likely expect.</p>
<p>I came into this exam with years of experience with markup languages like HTML and CSS, so most of the code examples were easy for me. However, the business related questions did trip me up a bit. Unfortunately I had to retake this exam because, when I went to sign up for the exam the first time, I accidentally signed up for the CIW Web Foundations exam instead, which is a 90 question exam that covers the CIW Internet Business Associate, CIW Site Development Associate, and the CIW Network Technology Associate. So be careful when scheduling your exam!</p>
