<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Project</h5> 
<P>This course uses a programming project. In order to pass, you need to follow instructions provided on the course page to create and submit a Python program implementing an algorithm of your choice (but most likely the Shortest Path). Once you complete your project you will need to write a paper explaining which algorithm you used and why you used it. Once you've finished your program and paper, you'll need to submit your them as a zip file to be evaluated and see whether it is accepted (and you pass).</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I haven’t enrolled in it yet. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.</p>

<h5>Helpful Links:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/wgu.edu/eric-christiansen/home/C950?authuser=0">Eric Christiansen's C950 Supplemental Support Page</a> - The gold standard in learning resources for a lot of the useful resources for this course that I'm not going to bother copying here (because there's so many!!).</b></li>
  <li><a href="https://motleybytes.com/w/WGUplus/C950_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_II">WGUplus/C950 Data Structures and Algorithms II</a> - Professor Christiansen also maintains a wiki that includes pages on a lot of WGU courses (some of which also have detailed course notes).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Download Page</a> - You're likely going to need to download it, but also having the documentation bookmarked is helpful.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/wgu.edu/eric-christiansen/home/python?authuser=0">Python Information</a> - Another or Professor Christiansen's pages. This one has links to the Python download pages you'll need.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/Python-SelfStudy-Notes">Python-SelfStudy-Notes</a> - I've begun to maintain a repository here for notes and sample code from my Python( including Data Structures I/II) learning resources. If you're interested in reading them, stay tuned.</li>
