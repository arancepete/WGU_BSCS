# C961 – Ethics in Technology – 3cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>None, although I recommend you take <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C836.md">C836 – Fundamentals of Information Security</a> either before or concurrently because the course content provides a lot of overlap.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 70 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Ethical Decision Making</b> for 14%, <b>Ethical Impacts with Data Privacy</b> for 19%, <b>Ethical Impacts with Data Accuracy</b> for 19%, <b>Ethical Impacts with Data Property</b> for 19%, <b>Ethical Impacts with Data Access</b> for 17%, and <b>Professional Code of Ethics</b> for 13% of the assessment.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>I took C961 directly after C836 - Fundamentals of Information Security. This is the third class in what I would call the "Security Line", the first being <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C172.md">C172 - Network and Security - Foundations</a>. Once you've read the content from C836, you'll have a good basis to take and pass this exam. That's what I did. I never even touched the UCertify for this course.</p>
<p>A lot of what you'll be tested on will come down to your ability to determine what is ethical or unethical and what is illegal or legal. While it  may be easy for you to figure out what is ethical and legal and what is unethical and illegal, there's a very grey area for things that are unethical but legal and ethical but illegal. Laws will also make up a good portion of this exam. You may remember many of them mentioned in previous classes, which is why I can't stress enough to take this with of after C836.</p>
  <p>This is an exam where taking the Practice Assessment first and going over it to determine WHY certain answers are on certain parts of the spectrum is important. Once you've learned how to easily make those distinctions, everything on the Objective Assessment will be common sense.</p>

There's a lot of similar ground covered because many of the ethical issues you'll be tested on are directly related to security or principles of the CIA Triad.</li></ul>
