## My Experiences with Class
Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I transferred it into my degree program. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help!

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Composition I Textbook](https://wgu.mindedgeonline.com) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. | 
| [Purdue's APA Formatting and Style Guide, 7th Ed](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html) | Website / Guide | If you're new to writing papers in APA Style, you may want to read this guide on the format from Purdue. | 
| [WGU's Writing Center](https://my.wgu.edu/success-centers/writing-center) | Website | WGU has a dedicated area for writing resources called the Writing Center. When you log into the portal it will be under "Success Centers", but this link will also take you directly to it. You can call, chat, email, and set up appointments with someone from there for extra help. | 
| [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) | Software / Service | Since we're our own worst proofreaders, it may be worth putting your essays through Grammerly before submitting them. You can check [this page](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/Need-Writing-Support-gt-START-HERE-lt/ta-p/25830) for a discount code or use the free version. | 
| [Natural Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/) | Software / Service | This is the document reader I usually use when I proofread (specifically the free version). You can choose to open a document into it or paste your own text into the program to read it. It doesn't offer the tools Grammerly does, just text-to-speech. | 
| [Guide to Academic Writing](https://wgu.mindedgeonline.com/index.php) | Website / Guide | Another resource that WGU offers; a guide to Academic Writing that covers brainstorming, outlining, composition structure, word choice, grammar, etc. Even if you've transferred this course in as I have, this guide is worth bookmarking for later papers and essays (like...the Capstone).  | 
| [A Writer's Reference by Diana Hacker and Nancy Sommers](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/A-Writers-Reference/p/1319169406) | Textbook | This is the textbook that was required for every writing course at my old community college. It's basically the [adult version of Writer's Express](https://images.app.goo.gl/cyVSDSRbJEbocTBj9) (for those who were in grade school in the 2000s). |
