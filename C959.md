##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Discrete Mathematics I helps candidates develop competence in the use of abstract, discrete structures fundamental to computer science. In particular, this course will introduce candidates to logic and proofs; Boolean algebra and functions; set theory; finite and infinite sequences and series; and relations, graphs, and trees. The course emphasizes applications in computer science. Calculus I is a prerequisite for this course.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.* 
- *The graduate evaluates the truth of statements using proofs and the principles of deductive logic.* 
- *The graduate analyzes relationships between sets and functions.* 
- *The graduate minimizes circuits using Boolean algebra and Boolean functions.* 
- *The graduate performs matrix operations.* 
- *The graduate analyzes finite and infinite series.* 
- *The graduate analyzes mathematical problems using relations.* 
- *The graduate analyzes graphs, trees, and the associated data point connections*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam called an Objective Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the 72 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- Logic and Proofs for 22% 
- Set Theory, Finite Sequences, and Series for 16%

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| [GeeksforGeeks' Engineering Mathematics Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics-tutorials/) | Websites | The topics for each section are significantly more condensed than most math courses', but you may find them much more helpful. Definitely check out their Computer Science topic articles as well. |
| [GeeksforGeeks' Digital Electronics and Logic Design Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-electronics-logic-design-tutorials/) | Websites | GfG's tutorials cover Boolean Algebra and Functions, although it's probably more than you need for this course. Their explanations may be more helpful however. |
| [r/learnmath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/) | Websites | The subreddit dedicated to helping you learn math. If none of the resources here seem to help, it's likely you'll find something there or find someone who can answer your questions. | 
| [Mathematics (Stack Exchange)](https://math.stackexchange.com/) | Websites | Another great source to turn to in case any of the above doesn't seem to work. You can sort specific subjects by tag, search existing questions, and ask your own. |
