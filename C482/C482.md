<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Project</h5> 
<P>This course uses a coding project. In order to pass, you need to follow instructions provided on the course page to create and submit a Java project and documentation on it. Once you've finished your program and paper, you'll need to submit your project as a zip file to be evaluated and see whether it is accepted (and you pass).</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I haven’t enrolled in it yet. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.</p>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learn.zybooks.com">C482 Software I Java Zybooks</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the Zybooks for the class. When I first activated C482 it was a UCertify based on the Oracle Programmer certification but I believe they've since switched over to Zybooks.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/">Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Edition by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson</a> - Not only is this a really essentially book, but because the Performance Assessment ties into the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern, you're probably going to want to read about it. Be sure to check it out in Chapter 12 (bonus, this book is in Java if I recall correctly).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/0596009208/">Head First Java, 2nd Edition by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates</a> - If you're new to Java and prefer to learn by reading, this is a great book to do so.</li>
