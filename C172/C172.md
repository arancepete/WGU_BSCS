## My Experiences with Class
This class was an absolute slog. Not only was the UCertify dry and difficult to get through, but I failed the Objective Assessment twice. I was lucky however that during my time taking the class I was able to switch to a new version of the course which reset my exam attempts and also removed some of the harder parts of the original material such as subnetting and replaced it with concepts from C836 – Fundamentals of Information Security.


The irony to all of this of course, was that in order to pass this exam, I actually ended up using C836's UCertify which is a far more interesting and quicker read. The Security aspects of Networking I felt were just far easier for me to grasp than subnetting. Beyond that, I also struggled to find learning resources that could make the concepts click for me. I tried the CompTIA Network+ series that everyone spoke so highly about, but no amount of colorful props could make the concepts stick. Luckily, with the switch to the new version of C172, I also found a series of courses on Plurasight that not only helped those difficult concepts click, but it made me appreciate the field of Networking.


If you're new to WGU, it's possible that this course may have undergone another change. Like [C958 - Calculus I](C958.md), C172 is a very "fat" course that many new students get stuck on. They've been trying to balance the course's difficulty and the difficult concepts that are necessary to understand Networking for a while. So, by the time you take it they may have lowered the weight of the Security section. The links I'm going to include should be useful regardless.


And a final note. If C172 is making you feel stressed out or like you want to quit, don't. I failed the OA four times (through two different versions) before I was able to pass it. Because it was in the first semester along with C958 when I started, it held me back from progressing as far as a lot of the other students who started during the first big BSCS wave I enrolled during. In fact, many of them are probably already graduates. My point is, don't give up! This degree program has some obnoxiously tough courses in it, but you will pass them! Hopefully this repo will be the path that leads you to that finish line. 


Also, once you’ve passed the OA, I recommend giving the field of networking another serious look in your free time and read Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Network & Security - Foundations Textbook](https://wgu.ucertify.com/) | Interactive Online Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. It likely has changed since I passed this course. The two versions I used were very dry and difficult to get through. The one saving grace is that the course instructors stuffed a number of very useful videos into it that explained the material better than the text did. | 
| [Fundamentals of Information Security Textbook](https://wgu.ucertify.com/) | Interactive Online Textbook | When you activate the C836 course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. This textbook is absolutely fantastic and helped me pass not one, but three courses; C172, C836, and [C961 – Ethics in Technology](C961.md). I was lucky that when I began you could activate every course and access the course materials early, but that's since been changed. If you're new to the program I recommend asking your program mentor to either allow you to take C836 BEFORE this course or concurrently. | 
| [Professor Messer's CompTIA Network and Security Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/professormesser/videos) | Video Course | Professor Messer is absolutely the greatest thing to happen to CompTIA's Network+ and Security+. He is an incredible teacher and his videos are an amazing resource for anyone struggling through this course. | 
| [Plurasight's Networking Concepts and Protocols by Ross Bagurdes](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/comptia-network-plus-networking-concepts/table-of-contents) | Video Course | If Professor Messer is the greatest thing to happen to Network+ and Security+, Ross Bagurdes is the second greatest. This is by far one of the most beginner-friendly introductions to Networking I have watched. Even better, you can watch it at 2X speed and still follow it clearly. | 
| [Plurasight's Network Security Basics by Ross Bagurdes](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/network-security-fundamentals/table-of-contents) | Video Course | Ross Bagurdes' second course on Network Security makes for a great introduction to the concepts of Security. Paired with the above, you'll have everything you need to pass this course. | 
| [Linkedin Learning: Prepare for the CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Certification](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-comptia-network-plus-n10-007-certification?u=2045532) | Video Course | This "learning path" includes all of the Mike Meyers Network+ course videos. I personally preferred Professor Messer, but many people also prefer Meyer's approach. | 
| [Linkedin Learning: Become a CompTIA Security+ Certified Security Professional](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-comptia-security-plus-certified-security-professional?u=2045532) | Video Course | This "learning path" includes all of the Security+ videos by Mike Chapple. This course covers a large swath of Security-related concepts so if you aren't watching Professor Messer's videos, you ought to watch these (plus, the course instructors stuck them into the textbook). | 
| [Professor Messer’s Network+ Notes](https://www.professormesser.com/n10-007-success-bundle/) | Textbook | Personally, I felt that his free video courses on YouTube were enough to pass, but you can also buy a copy of his Network+ notes. | 
| [CompTIA Network+ Study Guide : Exam N10-007, 4th Ed by Todd Lammle](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1788865&site=eds-live&scope=site) | Textbook | Although you won't be taking the actual Network+, thanks to WGU's Library you will gain access to the official Network+ Study Guide. | 
| [SubnettingQuestions.com](https://www.subnettingquestions.com/) | Website | On the more recent version of the exam I didn't find any subnetting questions, however, just in case there are, be sure to study up on it! | 
| [Stanford University: CS144 Introduction to Computer Networking Fall 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvFG2xYBrYAQCyz4Wx3NPoYJOFjvU7g2Z) | Video Course | Since the concept of Networking is very important to computer science itself, it may be worth it to take a step back from the Network+-centric resources and get a better idea of *what* Networking is. |
| [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Ed by James Kurose and Keith Ross](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kurose-Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach-7th-Edition/PGM1101673.html) | Textbook | In case you’d like a good textbook to help with understanding the field of Networking, this is one of the most recommended ones. | 
| [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, Wireshark Labs](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/wireshark.htm) | Website | To supplement your learning, the authors of Computer Networking have a website with exercises and labs that are far better than the course textbook’s. |
