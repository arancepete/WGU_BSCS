# C964 – Computer Science Capstone – 4cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Every course in the degree program</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Graduation</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Capstone</h5>
<p>This is your final course, the capstone! To pass this class you'll need to develop a project and write a supporting capstone paper on it (after you finish your project proposal of course). Just like every other Performance Assessment type course, you'll need to submit it to find out whether you pass and join the ranks of the BSCS Alumni ranks. Good luck! And be sure to read the Ultimate Capstone Guide.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I haven’t enrolled in it yet. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.</p>
