<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Project</h5>
<p>This course uses a programming project. In order to pass, you need to follow instructions provided on the course page to create and submit a C++ Project. You'll be limited to either Visual Studio or XCode as your IDE depending upon what system you're using. Instructions for how to install both IDEs are included on the course page. Once you've finished programming, you'll need to submit your project as a zip file to be evaluated and see whether it is accepted (and you pass).</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>This was my first class with a project (Performance Assessment) during the degree program, and my first big programming project as well. Some of the more important components of this course are using <b>Arrays</b> and <b>Pointers</b>. Although, I've heard people have submitted and passed this class using <b>Vectors</b> instead of Arrays, as far as I know you aren't supposed to.</p>
<p>Although I was new to C++ when I started this course, I wasn't new to programming or data structures, so learning the C++ syntax wasn't too bad. In fact, I've found I really like the structure of C++ more than my time with Python and Ruby, the latter of which was the first programming language I learned as a kid. This course's zybooks isn't bad, there's a lot of programming challenges to nail the syntax in to you. My only qualm is the amount of emphasis it puts on learning and using Vectors over Arrays, in a course where you're not actually allowed to use Vectors.</p>
<p>In a lot of the write ups you'll read below, you'll likely hear about a playlist of videos called the "book repo" that other people followed while working on the course. It was a series of videos created by one of the course instructors that explained the C867 project using a similarly structured but not 100% exact copy of it. Unfortunately, the playlist was taken down after the evaluators caught some students copying the instructor's code. It was replaced by a new "Course Tips" section on the course page with videos of different coding projects by the same instructor. I believe they're adding more tips and videos to it, but so far it's actually pretty great. It even includes a page on how to incrementally develop your project.</p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/Cpp-Studying-Practice">Cpp-Studying-Practice</a> - I've begun to maintain a repository here for C++ coding practice using my learning resources. I've split each source into a separate branch with its own source code you can download and test to learn as I learn.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">The C++ Resources Network</a> - One of the best reference websites for C++. What's really great is that each piece of the syntax has a separate page with a detailed explanation about how it works as well as sample code.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">C++ reference</a> - Having a good reference on hand while you code it invaluable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">LearnCpp.com</a> - If you're new to C++, this is a great site that will walk you through in increments on working with the language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw">The Cherno</a> - The Cherno has a great series on C++, covering every single topic very indepth. You'll want to check out his video on Pointers especially.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQZ1qmKlLY">Buckey Roberts's C++ Tutorials</a> - Combined into a single 9 hour long video with chapters, Buckey's C++ tutorials are very beginner friendly and great.</li>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learn.zybooks.com">C++ Programming Zybooks</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the Zybooks for the class. It contains plenty of practice to help you get familiar with C++, but you may not feel completely prepared to complete the project.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Lippman-C-Primer-5th-Edition/PGM270560.html">C++ Primer, 5th Edition by Stanley B. Lippman, Josee Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo</a> - If you would rather use a textbook, the C++ Primer by Lippman, Lajoie, and Moo is probably the best beginner book out there.</li>
  <li><a href="">Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup</a> - The man, the myth, the legend, the creator of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup. This book is great for those new to C-based and programming in general.</li>
