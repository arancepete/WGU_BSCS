##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Introduction to Artificial Intelligence explores the foundational principles and practices of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and robotics. The course prepares students to analyze relationships, build agents, and create models relevant to AI problems. The prerequisites for this course are Introduction to Probability and Statistics as well as Data Structures and Algorithms II.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.*
- *The graduate analyzes the relationships and rules pertaining to intelligence within systems.*
- *The graduate writes code to enable robots to execute simple tasks.*
- *The graduate creates models with machine learning algorithms in order to extract actionable insights from data.*
- *The graduate distinguishes among search strategies to fit specific data-oriented problems.*
- *The graduate implements basic intelligent agent technology in order to automate services*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Project
This course uses a project called a Performance Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to follow instructions provided on the course page to two forms of Artificial Intelligence, a ChatBot and a BubbleRobot, and write three papers. Once you've finished your project, you will need to submit it to the task stream to be evaluated. If your project meets the criteria in the rubric, you will pass the course.
