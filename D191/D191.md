##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Advanced Data Management enables organizations to extract and analyze raw data. Skillful data management allows organizations to discover and explore data in ways that uncover trends, issues, and their root causes. In turn, businesses are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities and more accurately plan for the future. As organizations continue to extract larger and more detailed volumes of data, the need is rapidly growing for IT professionals possessing data management skills. These skills include performing advanced relational data modeling as well as designing data marts, lakes, and warehouses. This course will empower software developers with the skills to build business logic at the database layer to employ more stability and higher data-processing speeds. Data analysts will gain the ability to automate common tasks to summarize and integrate data as they prepare it for analysis. Data Management is a prerequisite for this course.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.*
- *The graduate writes complex SQL statements in order to implement functions, stored procedures, and triggers to prepare data sets for data analysis and manipulation.*
- *The graduate configures data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks in order to automate data integration*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam called an Performance Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the Performance Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:

## My Experiences with Class
I completed this class' PA on 10.15.2021 after second submission attempt. The course is a continuation of [C170 - Data Management - Applications](../C170/C170.md). I found this course to be very enjoyable especially since you have to adapt to using a new PostgeSQL DBMS as oppsed to continuing using Oracle's MySQL DBMS in C170. You will possibly use a DVD Rental database that is very popular for conducting data science operations and analysis in an educational manner. This course took me four weeks to complete, but as I stated earlier, I really enjoyed this course. If you’re looking for more information, there are some awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits that should help! I will continue to update this when I can.
