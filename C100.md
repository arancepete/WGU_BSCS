### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Introduction to the Humanities Textbook](https://wgu.mindedgeonline.com) | Interactive Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. | 
| [Acronyms for Themes Covered in C100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUsjP1dufR8&feature=youtu.be) | Video | A video created by one of the course mentors to help with memorizing the periods you'll be studying. | 
| [Introduction to Humanities V2: Task Works](https://wgu.libguides.com/humanitiesv2) | Website | The WGU Library has a dedicated page for all of the works you'll be choosing from for the paper, so you won't have to go digging for them! | 
| [WGU C100 Humanities Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/331682903/wgu-c100-humanities-flash-cards/) | Website | In a similar fashion to WGU's other OA-based general ed classes, you're going to be memorizing a lot of terms for this exam. | 
| [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) | Software / Service | Since we're our own worst proofreaders, it may be worth putting your essays through Grammerly before submitting them. You can check [this page](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/Need-Writing-Support-gt-START-HERE-lt/ta-p/25830) for a discount code or use the free version. | 
| [Natural Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/) | Software / Service | This is the document reader I usually use when I proofread (specifically the free version). You can choose to open a document into it or paste your own text into the program to read it. It doesn't offer the tools Grammerly does, just text-to-speech. | 
| [Guide to Academic Writing](https://wgu.mindedgeonline.com/index.php) | Website / Guide | Another resource that WGU offers; a guide to Academic Writing that covers brainstorming, outlining, composition structure, word choice, grammar, etc. Even if you've transferred this course in as I have, this guide is worth bookmarking for later papers and essays (like...the Capstone).  | 
| [A Writer's Reference by Diana Hacker and Nancy Sommers](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/A-Writers-Reference/p/1319169406) | Textbook | This is the textbook that was required for every writing course at my old community college. It's basically the [adult version of Writer's Express](https://images.app.goo.gl/cyVSDSRbJEbocTBj9) (for those who were in grade school in the 2000s). |
